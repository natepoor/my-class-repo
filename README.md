Refactor Horiseon website challenge

## my-class-repo refactored website in html

I treated this challenge like I was serving a customer and wanted to keep there needs in mind. I was able to keep the page looking the same, and make it accesible. My project stands out because I was able to change all the elements into accesible ones.

*Changed divs in containers to appropriate semantic elements 
*Changed blank website title where the tab is

### Known issues. Noticed search engine optimization link does not work properly, unable to fix without messing up the page layout
